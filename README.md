## 📊 Model Performance Results

### Evaluation Metrics
| Metric        | Training Set | Test Set   |
|---------------|--------------|------------|
| **RMSE**      | 0.3852       | 0.4697     |
| **R² Score**  | 0.8503       | 0.7742     |

### Key Observations:
1. The model achieves strong performance with:
   - 85.03% variance explained on training data (R²)
   - 77.42% variance explained on test data (R²)
   
2. Error metrics show:
   - Root Mean Square Error of 0.3852 on training
   - Slightly higher RMSE of 0.4697 on test data

3. The small gap between train/test performance suggests good generalization without significant overfitting.

## 📝 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how data science techniques can create valuable predictive models for real estate pricing. The results provide practical tools for buyers, sellers, and investors in the housing market.
